				<h2 class="headingsr">The CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h2>
				<p class="infor">The Central Processing Unit(CPU) is known as the brains of the computer. <br> 
					It is a critical part to a computer, but it can't not function without the <br>help of other components. 
						The CPU is typically located in the center of the MotherBoard.</p>
				<img class="imgr" src="CPUC.jpg" alt="CPU Cooler">
				<h2 class="headingsl">CPU Cooler</h2>
				<p class="infol">The CPU cooler's job is to provide cooling to the CPU<br>
				It is typically made with 1 fan or more and cooling fins and/or tubes. There is also water<br>
				cooling. These usaully use an All in one cooler(AIO). and require more space.<br> 
				The CPU cooler sits on top on the cpu and requires thermal paste for bonding to the CPU. It is<br>
				also screwed into the MotherBoard itself.</p>
